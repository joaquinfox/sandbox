# sandbox
This sandbox is a practice environment and emerging tutorial of front-end development skills, including html, css and js. Like most of my repositories to date, it is part play-pen, part tutorial and part journal, of my progress as a novice developer.

The code in the sandbbox is stolen or adapted from, or inspired by several sources, most notably,

  * Jon Duckett's excellent book, "JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY", and
  * Michael Hartl's "Learn Enough To Be Dangerous", tutorials and website.
